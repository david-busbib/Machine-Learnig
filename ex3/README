Machine Learning - Exercise 3: PAC, Regularization, Ensemble Methods & Cross Validation
This project explores the concepts of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learnability, VC-dimension, sample complexity, agnostic PAC,
and ensemble methods (boosting) in machine learning. It involves both theoretical analysis and practical implementation using Python
