# GradientDescentLearning

GradientDescentLearning is a Python library designed to implement gradient descent optimization methods for machine learning tasks.
The package includes base modules for gradient descent, logistic regression, cross-validation, and different learning rate strategies.

## Features

- **Gradient Descent Algorithm**: Supports fixed and exponential learning rates.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implements L1 and L2 regularization.
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluate models using k-fold cross-validation.
- **Custom Loss Functions**: Includes MSE, cross-entropy, and misclassification error.

## Installation

Ensure you have `Python 3.x` installed, then use the following to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
